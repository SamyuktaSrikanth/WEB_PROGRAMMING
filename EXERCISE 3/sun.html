            <b><font color="#d93a1a">The Sun: Our Vital Star</font></b><br><br>

            The Sun is the heart of our solar system, a massive ball of hot, glowing gas composed mainly of hydrogen (about 75%) and helium (about 24%). It is located approximately 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth and is the source of all light and heat for our planet. The Sun's energy drives weather patterns, supports plant life through photosynthesis, and regulates the climate on Earth.

            <br><br><b><font color="#d93a1a">Key Facts About the Sun:</font></b>
        <ul>
           <li> <b><font color="#d93a1a">Size and Composition:</b></font>  The Sun is about 109 times larger in diameter than Earth and contains more than 99.8% of the total mass of the solar system. Its core reaches temperatures of approximately 27 million°F (15 million°C).</li>
            
           <br><li><font color="#d93a1a"><b>Energy Production:</b></font>  Through a process called nuclear fusion, hydrogen atoms in the Sun's core fuse to form helium, releasing vast amounts of energy in the form of light and heat. This process has been happening for around 4.6 billion years and is expected to continue for another 5 billion years.</li>
            
           <br><li> <b><font color="#d93a1a">Solar System Influence:</font></b>The Sun's gravitational pull keeps all planets, including Earth, in orbit. It also creates solar winds—streams of charged particles—that can affect Earth's magnetosphere and even cause auroras in the polar regions.</li>
            
            <br><li><b><font color="#d93a1a">Sunlight Travel:</font></b> It takes about 8 minutes and 20 seconds for light from the Sun to reach Earth, traveling at a speed of 186,000 miles per second (300,000 kilometers per second).</li>
            
           <br><li><b> <font color="#d93a1a">Sunspots and Solar Flares:</font></b>The Sun’s surface has areas of intense magnetic activity, known as sunspots. These regions are cooler than the surrounding areas and can cause solar flares, which are bursts of energy that affect satellite communications and power grids on Earth.</li>
        </ul>
            
            <b><font color="#d93a1a">The Importance of the Sun:</font></b><br>
            
            Without the Sun, life as we know it would not be possible. Its warmth and energy support life, agriculture, and ecosystems across the globe. Understanding the Sun helps scientists study solar phenomena, improve technology, and prepare for solar events that might impact our planet.
