            Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known place in the universe that supports life. With a diverse range of environments, from vast oceans to towering mountains and expansive deserts, Earth’s surface is constantly shaped by natural processes like weathering, erosion, and plate tectonics. It has a unique atmosphere, composed of 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases, which helps regulate temperature and protect life from harmful solar radiation.

            <br><br><b><font color="#78fc04">Key Facts About the Sun:</font></b>
        <ul>
           <li> <b><font color="#78fc04">Size and Composition:</b></font>  Earth is the fifth-largest planet in our solar system, with a diameter of about 7,917 miles (12,742 kilometers). It consists of a solid inner core, a molten outer core, a mantle, and a thin, rocky crust.</li>
            
           <br><li><font color="#78fc04"><b>Water Coverage:</b></font>  About 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water, with oceans making up most of that. Freshwater accounts for only about 3% of the total water on the planet, and it's crucial for sustaining life.</li>
            
           <br><li> <b><font color="#78fc04">Atmosphere and Climate:</font></b>Earth's atmosphere, made up mostly of nitrogen and oxygen, plays a vital role in maintaining the planet's temperature. It acts as a protective shield against harmful radiation from the Sun and helps to sustain life through processes like the water cycle.</li>
            
            <br><li><b><font color="#78fc04">Orbital Dynamics:</font></b> Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of 93 million miles (150 million kilometers), completing one orbit every 365.25 days. The tilt of Earth's axis causes seasonal variations in temperature and day length.</li>
            
           <br><li><b> <font color="#78fc04">Geological Activity:</font></b>Earth’s surface is continuously reshaped by geological processes, such as volcanic activity, earthquakes, and the movement of tectonic plates. This dynamic nature helps maintain a balance of gases and nutrients necessary for life.</li>
        </ul>
            
            <b><font color="#78fc04">The Importance of Earth:</font></b><br>
            
            Earth is not just a home for humans, but for millions of species of plants, animals, and microorganisms. Its ecosystems support biodiversity, provide resources like air and water, and regulate global temperatures. Understanding Earth’s systems is crucial for protecting its environment, managing natural resources, and ensuring a sustainable future for all life forms.
